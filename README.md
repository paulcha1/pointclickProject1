<h1>Why I choose this game? :</h1>

seemed simple enough that i could do it with things we learned in class during these past 2/3 weeks and allowed me to train using DOM and CSS + i like this kind of humor

Key features :

buttons, eventlisteners and queryselectors everywhere, with a few timeout on top of it. Also a few cool functions like incrementing the color red of the background on a click or typing

What's next?

making the game longer, trying to implement some actual puzzles (maybe some where the answer is a number an has to be entered by the user, then checked by the code.
